Created an end to end CICD pipeline using Jenkins to deploy a java web application, leveraging various tools for every stage of the pipeline like SonarQube for code analysis, docker to create container image of our application, Sonatype Nexus to store the docker images in a private repository, helm charts to deploy the application on the k8s-cluster, datree.io to identify misconfiguration in our helm charts before deploying the application. 
Also used Terraform and ansible to provision and configure the resources on AWS, required for setting up the infrastructure needed for the CICD pipeline like setting up Jenkins server, SonarQube server, Sonatype Nexus server for hosting private docker and helm repositories and a kubernetes cluster to deploy our application.

V5
Developed and executed an end-to-end CICD pipeline utilizing Jenkins to deploy a Java web application. Employed a range of tools at each stage of the pipeline, including SonarQube for code analysis, Docker for containerizing the application, Sonatype Nexus to store Docker images in a private repository, and Helm charts and datree.io for identifying misconfigurations in the charts before deploying the application to the Kubernetes cluster. Utilized Terraform and Ansible to provision and configure AWS resources required for establishing the infrastructure necessary for the CICD pipeline, such as Jenkins server, SonarQube server, Sonatype Nexus server for hosting private Docker and Helm repositories, and a Kubernetes cluster for deploying the application.
